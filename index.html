    <p>Hi! I'm Ece. I'm a first year master student Design for Interaction at TU Delft. I am currently looking for an internship abroad in the interaction field. I have experience with designing interactive experiences, products and environments. I have done my BSc IDE at TU Delft as well and during my Bachelor's, I went abroad and studied at Loughborough University for a semester. What I learned here was the importance of research and how we need to take the time to do it. I would love to learn more about designing in practice. Thank you for reading this.</p>
